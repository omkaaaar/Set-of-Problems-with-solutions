## 📌 Disclaimer

All the solutions in this repository are based on **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet**. Huge thanks to [Striver](https://takeuforward.org/) for creating such a well-structured and beginner-friendly resource — it's been incredibly helpful in improving my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

If you're looking for a more in-depth explanation of these problems, I highly recommend checking out the original sheet here:
